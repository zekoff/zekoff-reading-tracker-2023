        "2 Samuel 1\u20132\n\nDavid Hears of Saul\u2019s Death\n\n  [1] After the death of Saul, when David had returned from striking down the Amalekites, David remained two days in Ziklag. [2] And on the third day, behold, a man came from Saul\u2019s camp, with his clothes torn and dirt on his head. And when he came to David, he fell to the ground and paid homage. [3] David said to him, \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d And he said to him, \u201cI have escaped from the camp of Israel.\u201d [4] And David said to him, \u201cHow did it go? Tell me.\u201d And he answered, \u201cThe people fled from the battle, and also many of the people have fallen and are dead, and Saul and his son Jonathan are also dead.\u201d [5] Then David said to the young man who told him, \u201cHow do you know that Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?\u201d [6] And the young man who told him said, \u201cBy chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and behold, the chariots and the horsemen were close upon him. [7] And when he looked behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, \u2018Here I am.\u2019 [8] And he said to me, \u2018Who are you?\u2019 I answered him, \u2018I am an Amalekite.\u2019 [9] And he said to me, \u2018Stand beside me and kill me, for anguish has seized me, and yet my life still lingers.\u2019 [10] So I stood beside him and killed him, because I was sure that he could not live after he had fallen. And I took the crown that was on his head and the armlet that was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.\u201d\n\n  [11] Then David took hold of his clothes and tore them, and so did all the men who were with him. [12] And they mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and for Jonathan his son and for the people of the LORD and for the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword. [13] And David said to the young man who told him, \u201cWhere do you come from?\u201d And he answered, \u201cI am the son of a sojourner, an Amalekite.\u201d [14] David said to him, \u201cHow is it you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD\u2019s anointed?\u201d [15] Then David called one of the young men and said, \u201cGo, execute him.\u201d And he struck him down so that he died. [16] And David said to him, \u201cYour blood be on your head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, \u2018I have killed the LORD\u2019s anointed.\u2019\u201d\n\nDavid\u2019s Lament for Saul and Jonathan\n\n  [17] And David lamented with this lamentation over Saul and Jonathan his son, [18] and he said it(1) should be taught to the people of Judah; behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar.(2) He said:\n\n    [19] \u201cYour glory, O Israel, is slain on your high places!\n        How the mighty have fallen!\n    [20] Tell it not in Gath,\n        publish it not in the streets of Ashkelon,\n    lest the daughters of the Philistines rejoice,\n        lest the daughters of the uncircumcised exult.\n    \n    \n    [21] \u201cYou mountains of Gilboa,\n        let there be no dew or rain upon you,\n        nor fields of offerings!(3)\n    For there the shield of the mighty was defiled,\n        the shield of Saul, not anointed with oil.\n    \n    \n    [22] \u201cFrom the blood of the slain,\n        from the fat of the mighty,\n    the bow of Jonathan turned not back,\n        and the sword of Saul returned not empty.\n    \n    \n    [23] \u201cSaul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely!\n        In life and in death they were not divided;\n    they were swifter than eagles;\n        they were stronger than lions.\n    \n    \n    [24] \u201cYou daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\n        who clothed you luxuriously in scarlet,\n        who put ornaments of gold on your apparel.\n    \n    \n    [25] \u201cHow the mighty have fallen\n        in the midst of the battle!\n    \n    \n    \u201cJonathan lies slain on your high places.\n    [26]     I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;\n    very pleasant have you been to me;\n        your love to me was extraordinary,\n        surpassing the love of women.\n    \n    \n    [27] \u201cHow the mighty have fallen,\n        and the weapons of war perished!\u201d\n    \n    \n    David Anointed King of Judah\n\n  [1] After this David inquired of the LORD, \u201cShall I go up into any of the cities of Judah?\u201d And the LORD said to him, \u201cGo up.\u201d David said, \u201cTo which shall I go up?\u201d And he said, \u201cTo Hebron.\u201d [2] So David went up there, and his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel. [3] And David brought up his men who were with him, everyone with his household, and they lived in the towns of Hebron. [4] And the men of Judah came, and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.\n\n  When they told David, \u201cIt was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul,\u201d [5] David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead and said to them, \u201cMay you be blessed by the LORD, because you showed this loyalty to Saul your lord and buried him. [6] Now may the LORD show steadfast love and faithfulness to you. And I will do good to you because you have done this thing. [7] Now therefore let your hands be strong, and be valiant, for Saul your lord is dead, and the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.\u201d\n\nIsh-bosheth Made King of Israel\n\n  [8] But Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul\u2019s army, took Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim, [9] and he made him king over Gilead and the Ashurites and Jezreel and Ephraim and Benjamin and all Israel. [10] Ish-bosheth, Saul\u2019s son, was forty years old when he began to reign over Israel, and he reigned two years. But the house of Judah followed David. [11] And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.\n\nThe Battle of Gibeon\n\n  [12] Abner the son of Ner, and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. [13] And Joab the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David went out and met them at the pool of Gibeon. And they sat down, the one on the one side of the pool, and the other on the other side of the pool. [14] And Abner said to Joab, \u201cLet the young men arise and compete before us.\u201d And Joab said, \u201cLet them arise.\u201d [15] Then they arose and passed over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. [16] And each caught his opponent by the head and thrust his sword in his opponent\u2019s side, so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim,(4) which is at Gibeon. [17] And the battle was very fierce that day. And Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.\n\n  [18] And the three sons of Zeruiah were there, Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as swift of foot as a wild gazelle. [19] And Asahel pursued Abner, and as he went, he turned neither to the right hand nor to the left from following Abner. [20] Then Abner looked behind him and said, \u201cIs it you, Asahel?\u201d And he answered, \u201cIt is I.\u201d [21] Abner said to him, \u201cTurn aside to your right hand or to your left, and seize one of the young men and take his spoil.\u201d But Asahel would not turn aside from following him. [22] And Abner said again to Asahel, \u201cTurn aside from following me. Why should I strike you to the ground? How then could I lift up my face to your brother Joab?\u201d [23] But he refused to turn aside. Therefore Abner struck him in the stomach with the butt of his spear, so that the spear came out at his back. And he fell there and died where he was. And all who came to the place where Asahel had fallen and died, stood still.\n\n  [24] But Joab and Abishai pursued Abner. And as the sun was going down they came to the hill of Ammah, which lies before Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. [25] And the people of Benjamin gathered themselves together behind Abner and became one group and took their stand on the top of a hill. [26] Then Abner called to Joab, \u201cShall the sword devour forever? Do you not know that the end will be bitter? How long will it be before you tell your people to turn from the pursuit of their brothers?\u201d [27] And Joab said, \u201cAs God lives, if you had not spoken, surely the men would not have given up the pursuit of their brothers until the morning.\u201d [28] So Joab blew the trumpet, and all the men stopped and pursued Israel no more, nor did they fight anymore.\n\n  [29] And Abner and his men went all that night through the Arabah. They crossed the Jordan, and marching the whole morning, they came to Mahanaim. [30] Joab returned from the pursuit of Abner. And when he had gathered all the people together, there were missing from David\u2019s servants nineteen men besides Asahel. [31] But the servants of David had struck down of Benjamin 360 of Abner\u2019s men. [32] And they took up Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father, which was at Bethlehem. And Joab and his men marched all night, and the day broke upon them at Hebron.\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 1:18 Septuagint; Hebrew *the Bow*, which may be the name of the lament\u2019s tune\n\n(2) 1:18 Or *of the upright*\n\n(3) 1:21 Septuagint *firstfruits*\n\n(4) 2:16 *Helkath-hazzurim* means *the field of sword-edges*\n (ESV)",
        "1 Chronicles 11\n\nDavid Anointed King\n\n  [1] Then all Israel gathered together to David at Hebron and said, \u201cBehold, we are your bone and flesh. [2] In times past, even when Saul was king, it was you who led out and brought in Israel. And the LORD your God said to you, \u2018You shall be shepherd of my people Israel, and you shall be prince over my people Israel.\u2019\u201d [3] So all the elders of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD. And they anointed David king over Israel, according to the word of the LORD by Samuel.\n\nDavid Takes Jerusalem\n\n  [4] And David and all Israel went to Jerusalem, that is, Jebus, where the Jebusites were, the inhabitants of the land. [5] The inhabitants of Jebus said to David, \u201cYou will not come in here.\u201d Nevertheless, David took the stronghold of Zion, that is, the city of David. [6] David said, \u201cWhoever strikes the Jebusites first shall be chief and commander.\u201d And Joab the son of Zeruiah went up first, so he became chief. [7] And David lived in the stronghold; therefore it was called the city of David. [8] And he built the city all around from the Millo in complete circuit, and Joab repaired the rest of the city. [9] And David became greater and greater, for the LORD of hosts was with him.\n\nDavid\u2019s Mighty Men\n\n  [10] Now these are the chiefs of David\u2019s mighty men, who gave him strong support in his kingdom, together with all Israel, to make him king, according to the word of the LORD concerning Israel. [11] This is an account of David\u2019s mighty men: Jashobeam, a Hachmonite, was chief of the three.(1) He wielded his spear against 300 whom he killed at one time.\n\n  [12] And next to him among the three mighty men was Eleazar the son of Dodo, the Ahohite. [13] He was with David at Pas-dammim when the Philistines were gathered there for battle. There was a plot of ground full of barley, and the men fled from the Philistines. [14] But he took his(2) stand in the midst of the plot and defended it and killed the Philistines. And the LORD saved them by a great victory.\n\n  [15] Three of the thirty chief men went down to the rock to David at the cave of Adullam, when the army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. [16] David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then at Bethlehem. [17] And David said longingly, \u201cOh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem that is by the gate!\u201d [18] Then the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines and drew water out of the well of Bethlehem that was by the gate and took it and brought it to David. But David would not drink it. He poured it out to the LORD [19] and said, \u201cFar be it from me before my God that I should do this. Shall I drink the lifeblood of these men? For at the risk of their lives they brought it.\u201d Therefore he would not drink it. These things did the three mighty men.\n\n  [20] Now Abishai, the brother of Joab, was chief of the thirty.(3) And he wielded his spear against 300 men and killed them and won a name beside the three. [21] He was the most renowned(4) of the thirty(5) and became their commander, but he did not attain to the three.\n\n  [22] And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was a valiant man(6) of Kabzeel, a doer of great deeds. He struck down two heroes of Moab. He also went down and struck down a lion in a pit on a day when snow had fallen. [23] And he struck down an Egyptian, a man of great stature, five cubits(7) tall. The Egyptian had in his hand a spear like a weaver\u2019s beam, but Benaiah went down to him with a staff and snatched the spear out of the Egyptian\u2019s hand and killed him with his own spear.

        "Acts 21\n\nPaul Goes to Jerusalem\n\n  [1] And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara.(1) [2] And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. [3] When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo. [4] And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. [5] When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed [6] and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home.\n\n  [7] When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers(2) and stayed with them for one day. [8] On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. [9] He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. [10] While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. [11] And coming to us, he took Paul\u2019s belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, \u201cThus says the Holy Spirit, \u2018This is how the Jews(3) at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.\u2019\u201d [12] When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. [13] Then Paul answered, \u201cWhat are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.\u201d [14] And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, \u201cLet the will of the Lord be done.\u201d\n\n  [15] After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. [16] And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.\n\nPaul Visits James\n\n  [17] When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. [18] On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. [19] After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. [20] And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, \u201cYou see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law, [21] and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs. [22] What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. [23] Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; [24] take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law. [25] But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled,(4) and from sexual immorality.\u201d [26] Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them.\n\nPaul Arrested in the Temple\n\n  [27] When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him, [28] crying out, \u201cMen of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place.\u201d [29] For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. [30] Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. [31] And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. [32] He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. [33] Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done. [34] Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. [35] And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd, [36] for the mob of the people followed, crying out, \u201cAway with him!\u201d\n\nPaul Speaks to the People\n\n  [37] As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, \u201cMay I say something to you?\u201d And he said, \u201cDo you know Greek? [38] Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness?\u201d [39] Paul replied, \u201cI am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people.\u201d [40] And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language,(5) saying:\n\nFootnotes\n\n(1) 21:1 Some manuscripts add *and Myra*\n\n(2) 21:7 Or *brothers and sisters*; also verse 17\n\n(3) 21:11 Greek *Ioudaioi* probably refers here to Jewish religious leaders, and others under their influence, in that time\n\n(4) 21:25 Some manuscripts omit *and from what has been strangled*\n\n(5) 21:40 Or *the Hebrew dialect* (probably Aramaic)\n (ESV)"
